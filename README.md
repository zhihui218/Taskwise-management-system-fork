# Taskwise-management-system

TaskWise Management System is a multi-faceted management tool designed specifically for SMEs. It emphasizes strategic decision-making, acknowledging that effective task management within an SME involves a careful balance of various factors. Tasks are primarily derived from the SME's top management objectives and customer interactions. These tasks are then assigned to employees, considering individual capabilities, experience, and existing workloads.

A unique feature of TaskWise is its sophisticated performance assessment system. It evaluates employees based on their success in task completion, customer reviews, and adherence to the service level agreement's specified duration. This evaluation is achieved via a comprehensive Key Performance Indicator (KPI) pointing system.

Moreover, TaskWise improves documentation practices by providing an intuitive platform for both the SME's top management and its employees to upload and share files relevant to their respective tasks. The application also features a reporting module, providing an efficient mechanism for tracking tasks, monitoring progress, and generating insightful reports.
